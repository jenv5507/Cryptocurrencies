# Crypto currencies

This analysis was to help Accountability Accounting create a cryptocurrency investment portfolio to be able to offer to their customers.  We created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment.  

# Results

There were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies and based on the analysis, there are 4 classes. With this analysis, hopefully Accountability Accounting can create a successful investment portfolio for their clients!
